# Skate Park Pro - Architecture Overview

## Core Architecture

### Entry Points
- **index.html**: Main application entry point that loads the canvas and JavaScript modules
  - Contains a fullscreen canvas element for rendering the game
  - Loads the modular JavaScript components as ES6 modules

### Style & Layout
- **style.css**: Contains minimal styling to create a fullscreen canvas experience
  - Removes default margins and padding
  - Sets up the canvas to fill the entire viewport
  - Establishes core visual styling for the game interface

### JavaScript Module Structure
The game uses a modular architecture to separate concerns and allow for clean, maintainable code:

#### Core Files:
- `main.js`: Game entry point and main loop, initializes all required components
- `renderer.js`: Handles 3D rendering with ThreeJS, manages scene, camera, and visualization
- `physics.js`: Manages physics simulation using CannonJS, handles physical objects and collision
- `controls.js`: (Coming soon) Will handle player input from keyboard and touchscreen
- `ui.js`: (Coming soon) Will manage game UI elements and HUD

#### External Libraries:
- `three.module.js`: ThreeJS library for 3D rendering
- `cannon.module.js`: Simplified implementation of CannonJS for physics simulation
- `nipplejs.js`: (Coming soon) Will provide virtual joystick functionality

### Assets
- **assets/**: Directory for game resources
  - Will contain 3D models (skater, skate park elements)
  - Will store textures and materials
  - May include audio files for sound effects and music

### Testing
- **test.js**: Validates the project structure for Step 1
  - Checks for the existence of required files and directories
  - Confirms the module structure is valid

- **test-step2.js**: Validates the canvas initialization for Step 2
  - Confirms the canvas element exists and has proper dimensions
  - Verifies that a 2D context can be obtained from the canvas

- **test-step3.js**: Validates the ThreeJS implementation for Step 3
  - Checks if WebGL context is active
  - Verifies that animation is running
  - Prompts for visual confirmation of the 3D scene

## Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each JavaScript file has a single responsibility
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript module system for clean dependency management
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Cross-Platform**: Same codebase works on desktop and mobile browsers

## Graphics & Rendering
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated 3D graphics via ThreeJS
- **Responsive Canvas**: Automatically adjusts to viewport changes
- **Optimized Rendering**: Using proper ThreeJS techniques for performance
- **Lighting System**: Combination of ambient and directional lights
- **Animation Loop**: Efficient rendering using requestAnimationFrame

## Canvas Handling
- The canvas element fills the entire viewport
- Automatic resizing when the window size changes
- Resolution matching to prevent blurry rendering
- Consistent handling of WebGL context across browser environments

### Physics
- Using a simplified CannonJS implementation for physics simulation
- Physics world with configurable gravity
- Support for different body types:
  - Static bodies (ground plane)
  - Dynamic bodies (player character, objects)
- Collision detection and response
- Synchronization between physics bodies and visual representations
