# Implementation Plan for Skate Park Pro (Base Game)

This plan outlines the step-by-step instructions for implementing the core functionality of Skate Park Pro using ThreeJS, CannonJS, NippleJS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Each step is detailed with a specific goal and includes a test to verify correct implementation.

## 1. Project Setup & File Structure
- **Objective:** Establish a clean, modular file structure.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create the project repository with the following folders/files:
    - `index.html` – Main entry point.
    - `js/` – Contains game logic and library files.
    - `assets/` – Contains models, textures, and other assets.
    - `style.css` – Basic styling.
  - Separate your game modules (rendering, physics, controls, UI) into individual JavaScript files within `js/`.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Verify that the file structure matches the intended modular design by running a file explorer or tree command and confirming the layout.

---

## 2. Basic HTML & Canvas Initialization
- **Objective:** Set up the HTML structure with a canvas element for rendering.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create an HTML file with a `<canvas>` element.
  - Link the JavaScript and CSS files appropriately.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Open `index.html` in a browser and ensure an empty canvas is visible (even if blank).

---

## 3. ThreeJS Scene & Renderer Setup
- **Objective:** Initialize ThreeJS to render a 3D scene.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create a scene, camera, and renderer.
  - Add a basic geometry (e.g., a cube or plane) to the scene.
  - Set up the camera and position it to view the scene.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Launch the game and confirm that the basic geometry is visible on the canvas with correct perspective.

---

## 4. Integrate CannonJS for Physics
- **Objective:** Add physics simulation to the scene.
- **Instructions:**
  - Initialize the CannonJS physics world.
  - Create basic physics bodies (e.g., ground plane and a dynamic object representing a skateboarder or placeholder).
  - Link the physics simulation to the ThreeJS scene by synchronizing positions.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Observe the dynamic object interacting with the ground (e.g., falling under gravity and colliding with the plane).

---

## 5. Set Up NippleJS for Mobile Touch Controls
- **Objective:** Implement virtual joystick controls for mobile devices.
- **Instructions:**
  - Integrate NippleJS and configure a virtual joystick.
  - Define control zones for movement and trick inputs.
- **Validation Test:**
  - On a mobile device or using browser mobile emulation, check that the virtual joystick appears and registers touch input correctly.

---

## 6. Develop the Main Game Loop
- **Objective:** Establish a continuous loop to process inputs, update physics, and render the scene.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create a game loop that:
    - Processes user input (keyboard for desktop and NippleJS for mobile).
    - Updates physics simulation and object states.
    - Renders the updated scene using ThreeJS.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Log frame updates to the console and verify smooth and consistent updates, ensuring that both physics and rendering are synchronized.

---

## 7. Asset Loading & Model Integration
- **Objective:** Import low-poly 3D models for the skate park and skateboarder.
- **Instructions:**
  - Load models from the `assets/` directory using ThreeJS loaders (e.g., GLTFLoader).
  - Place the models into the scene with proper scaling and positioning.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Confirm that the skate park environment and skateboarder models appear correctly within the ThreeJS scene without distortion.

---

## 8. Implement Basic Trick Mechanics
- **Objective:** Create core gameplay mechanics for movement and trick execution.
- **Instructions:**
  - Define controls for basic actions:
    - Movement (WASD for desktop; virtual joystick for mobile).
    - Jump (Spacebar or touch gesture).
    - A simple trick (e.g., Ollie) triggered by a designated key or gesture.
  - Incorporate state changes (e.g., airborne, trick in progress) and integrate basic physics responses.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Execute movement and trick commands and verify through on-screen visual feedback or console logs that the correct game state transitions occur.

---

## 9. Day-Night Cycle & Dynamic Lighting
- **Objective:** Create a dynamic lighting system to simulate a day-night cycle.
- **Instructions:**
  - Set up directional and ambient lights in ThreeJS.
  - Program a timer-based cycle to transition between bright daytime and dim nighttime lighting.
  - Adjust lighting properties gradually to mimic a natural cycle.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Observe the scene over a few minutes to confirm that the lighting changes smoothly from day to night and vice versa.

---

## 10. User Interface (UI) & Score Display
- **Objective:** Develop a minimal, non-intrusive UI for displaying scores and combo multipliers.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create an HTML overlay or integrate UI elements within the canvas.
  - Display current score and combo multiplier in the top-left corner.
  - Ensure the UI updates in real time as the player performs actions.
- **Validation Test:**
  - Trigger score-changing events during gameplay and verify that the UI reflects these updates immediately and accurately.

By following these steps, you will build a robust base version of Skate Park Pro that is modular, performance-optimized, and provides immediate playability on both desktop and mobile browsers. Each step includes a clear test to ensure that every part of the implementation is validated before moving on.
