Game Design Document: Skate Park Pro
1. Overview
1.1 Game Concept
Skate Park Pro is a browser-based skateboarding game inspired by classics like Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Players control a skateboarder in a dynamic 3D skate park, performing tricks, chaining combos, and racking up scores. The game features a day-night cycle, seamless accessibility without login or signup, and optimized performance for instant play on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
1.2 Key Features
Core Gameplay: Skateboarding with movement, jumping, and trick mechanics.

Environment: A skate park with ramps, rails, and half-pipes, featuring a day-night cycle.

Controls: Keyboard/mouse for desktop, touch controls (via NippleJS) for mobile web.

Accessibility: Free-to-play, no login/signup, hosted on a custom domain/subdomain.

Performance: No loading screens or heavy downloads, instant play with minimal assets.

Platforms: Works on desktop browsers and mobile web (e.g., iPhone Safari), not as a native app.

1.3 Target Audience
Casual gamers and skateboarding enthusiasts.

Ages 13–35, familiar with browser games or classic skateboarding titles.

Players seeking quick, accessible fun without installation or account barriers.

1.4 Platform
Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on desktop and mobile devices.

Optimized for mobile web play (e.g., iPhone, Android) using responsive design and touch controls.

2. Gameplay
2.1 Objective
Players aim to perform tricks, chain combos, and achieve high scores while exploring the skate park. The focus is on skill-based gameplay and freedom of expression through skateboarding mechanics.
2.2 Core Mechanics
Movement
Desktop: WASD for movement (forward, backward, left, right), Spacebar for jumping.

Mobile Web: Virtual joystick (via NippleJS) for movement, tap/swipe for jumping.

Physics-based acceleration, deceleration, and turning to simulate skateboarding.

Tricks
Performable in the air or on rails:
Ollie: Basic jump (Spacebar or tap).

Kickflip: Flip trick (e.g., Q key or swipe up).

Grind: Rail trick (e.g., E key or swipe down when near a rail).

Combos: Chain tricks without landing poorly to increase a score multiplier.

Scoring
Each trick has a base score (e.g., Ollie = 100, Kickflip = 300, Grind = 500).

Combo multiplier increases with consecutive tricks (e.g., x2, x3, up to x10).

Failing (crashing or landing poorly) resets the multiplier.

2.3 Environment
Skate Park: A 3D space with ramps, rails, half-pipes, and flat areas for manuals.

Day-Night Cycle: Dynamic lighting transitions over time (e.g., 5-minute loop):
Day: Bright directional light (sun).

Night: Dim ambient light with point lights (e.g., park lamps).

Low-poly, optimized assets to maintain performance.

2.4 User Interface (UI)
Score Display: Top-left corner, showing current score and combo multiplier.

Minimal HUD: Avoid cluttering the screen, especially on mobile.

Optional Username Prompt: On game start, players can enter a username (stored locally, not required).

Settings Menu: Basic options (e.g., restart, mute sound if added later).

3. Technical Design
3.1 Engine and Libraries
ThreeJS: Core 3D rendering library for the browser.

CannonJS: Physics engine for skateboarding mechanics and collisions (lightweight alternative to AmmoJS).

NippleJS: Virtual joysticks for mobile web touch controls.

Tools: Blender (3D modeling), GIMP (textures), Webpack (bundling).

3.2 Performance Requirements
No Loading Screens: Assets load instantly or asynchronously.

Lightweight Assets:
Low-poly 3D models (e.g., <500 vertices for the skateboarder and park elements).

Compressed textures (JPEG/PNG, <100 KB each).

Optimization Techniques:
Level of Detail (LOD) for distant objects.

Object pooling for dynamic elements.

Simplified shaders for mobile compatibility.

3.3 Game Loop
Initialize: Set up ThreeJS scene, load minimal assets, configure physics.

Update:
Process input (keyboard/mouse or touch).

Update player position, physics, and trick states.

Adjust day-night cycle lighting.

Check collisions with ramps/rails.

Update score and UI.

Render: Draw the scene using ThreeJS.

3.4 Controls
Desktop
Movement: WASD (move), Spacebar (jump).

Tricks: Q (Kickflip), E (Grind), etc.

Camera: Mouse to adjust view.

Mobile Web
Movement: Left-side virtual joystick (NippleJS).

Jumping/Tricks: Right-side joystick or swipe gestures (e.g., up for Kickflip, down for Grind).

Camera: Auto-follows player, adjustable via pinch-zoom if needed.

3.5 Mobile Web Considerations
Responsive Design: Adapts to screen sizes and orientations (landscape preferred).

Performance: Targets 30 FPS on mid-range devices (e.g., iPhone 8).

Touch-Friendly UI: Large, unobtrusive buttons/joysticks.

4. Art and Audio
4.1 Visual Style
Low-Poly Aesthetic: Simple, clean models with flat or basic shading.

Color Palette: Vibrant daytime colors (blues, greens), cooler night tones (purples, grays).

Assets:
Skateboarder: Basic humanoid with a skateboard.

Skate Park: Modular pieces (ramps, rails, pipes).

4.2 Audio (Optional)
Sound Effects: Trick sounds (e.g., board flip, grind scrape) if bandwidth allows.

Background Music: Looping ambient track (optional, kept small or omitted for instant loading).

5. Accessibility and Distribution
5.1 Accessibility
No Login/Signup: Immediate play upon visiting the site.

Username Option: Optional input stored locally via browser storage (no backend required).

Free-to-Play: No monetization initially; ads or cosmetics can be added later if desired.

5.2 Hosting
Domain: Custom domain (e.g., skateparkpro.com) or subdomain (e.g., play.mydomain.com).

Platform: Static hosting via Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

HTTPS: Enabled for WebGL compatibility.

6. Development Plan
6.1 Milestones

Audio: Full sound effects and music if bandwidth permits.

8. Conclusion
Skate Park Pro will deliver a fast, fun, and accessible skateboarding experience in the browser. By leveraging ThreeJS, CannonJS, and NippleJS, and focusing on lightweight design, the game meets all requirements: instant play, no logins, mobile web compatibility, and a dynamic skate park with a day-night cycle. With an development plan, the project is ambitious yet achievable, offering a solid foundation for future expansion.
