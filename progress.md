# Development Progress

## Step 1: Project Setup & File Structure (Completed)
- Created modular file structure with index.html as the main entry point
- Established core CSS styling for responsive canvas display
- Set up js/ directory with modular JavaScript components:
  - main.js: Central game controller that initializes all systems
  - renderer.js: Will handle ThreeJS scene, camera, and rendering
  - physics.js: Will integrate CannonJS for game physics
  - controls.js: Will manage keyboard, mouse, and touch inputs
  - ui.js: Will handle game interface elements and scoring
- Created assets/ directory for future game assets
- Implemented test script to validate the project structure
- All files use modules for clean code organization and dependency management

## Step 2: Basic HTML & Canvas Initialization (Completed)
- Enhanced the main Game class to properly initialize and resize the canvas
- Implemented basic 2D drawing to verify canvas functionality
- Added window resize handling for responsive canvas dimensions
- Updated Renderer class to accept canvas reference for future ThreeJS implementation
- Created test script to validate canvas initialization
- Canvas now displays a visual indicator showing successful initialization

## Step 3: ThreeJS Scene & Renderer Setup (Completed)
- Downloaded and integrated ThreeJS as an ES6 module
- Implemented the Renderer class with ThreeJS functionality:
  - Created a 3D scene with proper camera and lighting
  - Added a rotating cube and ground plane as test geometry
  - Set up an animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
  - Implemented proper handling of window resize events
- Updated the main Game class to defer rendering to ThreeJS
- Created test script to validate ThreeJS initialization
- The scene now displays a rotating green cube above a gray plane

## Step 4: Integrate CannonJS for Physics (Completed)

In this step, we've successfully integrated physics simulation into our game using a simplified version of CannonJS. Key accomplishments:

- Created a simplified implementation of CannonJS to handle basic physics
- Implemented a Physics class that manages the physics world and bodies
- Added methods to create various physics shapes (ground plane, box, sphere)
- Integrated physics with the rendering system
- Created a test box that demonstrates gravity and collision with the ground
- Added a validation test to verify physics is working correctly
- Updated the game loop to step the physics simulation forward in time

The integration allows objects in the game to have realistic physical behaviors, including:
- Gravity affects objects appropriately
- Objects can collide with the ground and each other
- Physical properties like mass affect how objects move

### Next Steps
- Step 5: Set up NippleJS for mobile touch controls
