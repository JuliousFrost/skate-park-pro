# Skate Park Pro Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Created project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Set up THREE.js for 3D rendering
- Established a simple scene with camera and renderer
- Added basic error handling and debugging tools

## Step 2: Basic Environment Creation (Completed)
- Added a simple ground plane using THREE.js
- Implemented basic lighting (ambient and directional)
- Created a simple test cube for validation
- Set up camera position and orientation

## Step 3: Physics Engine Integration (Completed)
- Integrated Cannon.js physics engine
- Created synchronized physics world
- Added gravity and collision detection
- Established connection between THREE.js and Cannon.js objects

## Step 4: Character Controller (Completed)
- Implemented keyboard input handling (WASD, arrow keys, spacebar)
- Added character movement and jumping mechanics
- Created camera follow functionality
- Added collision response for the character

## Step 5: Mobile Control Setup (Completed)
- Added touch controls using nipplejs for movement
- Implemented responsive design for different screen sizes
- Created touch jump button
- Ensured controls work across devices

## Step 6: Develop the Main Game Loop (Completed)
- Implemented a precise timing system with deltaTime for frame-rate independent updates
- Added real-time FPS counter for performance monitoring
- Created distinct phases for input processing, physics updates, and scene rendering
- Added pause functionality for debugging and game control
- Implemented comprehensive debugging tools with real-time stats
- Created validation tests for consistent frame rates
- Added the "Dimensional Drift" mechanic, allowing players to switch between dimensions with different physics properties and unique visuals

The game loop provides a solid foundation for all gameplay features, while the dimensional drift mechanic adds strategic depth to the gameplay.

Next: Step 7: Asset Loading & Model Integration

## Step 7: Asset Loading & Model Integration (Completed)
- Developed a comprehensive asset loading system with:
  - Progress tracking and visualization via loading screen
  - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Queue-based loading for optimized performance
- Created custom 3D models using THREE.js primitives:
  - Detailed skate park environment with half-pipe, ramps, rails, and funbox 
  - Animated skateboarder character with skateboard
  - Dimensional portal as a visual indicator for dimension shifting
- Implemented model animation and interaction systems:
  - Character animations for movement, jumping, and tricks
  - Environment animations like the pulsing dimensional portal
  - Dynamic camera system that follows the player with smooth transitions
- Added dimension-specific visual changes to models
  - Character and skateboard appearance changes based on current dimension
  - Environment lighting and color adjustments

The enhanced 3D visuals create an immersive skateboarding experience while maintaining good performance across devices.

Next: Step 8: User Interface Development

## Step 8: User Interface Development (Completed)
- Created a comprehensive UI system with:
  - Dynamic in-game HUD for score, combo meter, and dimension indicator
  - Interactive menu system (main menu, pause menu, controls screen, game over)
  - Real-time feedback for tricks and dimension shifts
  - Adaptive design that works across different devices
- Implemented gameplay scoring systems:
  - Points system with trick detection based on jump height and dimension
  - Combo system with multipliers for consecutive tricks
  - Dimension shift tracking and rewards
- Added interactive elements:
  - Menu buttons with hover effects
  - Pause functionality with resume option
  - Game state management (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- Enhanced player feedback:
  - Visual notifications for successful tricks
  - Dimension change indicators
  - Score and stat tracking

The UI system creates a polished game experience with clear feedback to the player and all the necessary game management tools.
