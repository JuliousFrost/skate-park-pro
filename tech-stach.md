1. Rendering: ThreeJS
Purpose: 3D graphics rendering in the browser.

Why It’s Best:
Lightweight (~150 KB minified), ensuring fast loading.

Built on WebGL, supported by all modern browsers (desktop and mobile).

Simple API for creating 3D scenes, cameras, and lighting (e.g., day-night cycle).

Large community and extensive documentation.

Use Case: Renders the skate park, skateboarder, and dynamic lighting transitions.

Simplicity: Minimal setup—create a scene, camera, and renderer in under 20 lines of code.

Robustness: Handles 3D animations and mobile performance with optimization techniques like low-poly models.

2. Physics: CannonJS
Purpose: Physics simulation for skateboarding mechanics (movement, collisions, jumps).

Why It’s Best:
Lightweight (~100 KB minified), avoiding heavy downloads.

Designed to integrate seamlessly with ThreeJS (common pairing).

Simpler than alternatives like AmmoJS (Bullet port), with enough features for arcade-style physics.

Handles collisions with ramps, rails, and gravity for tricks.

Use Case: Simulates skateboard momentum, jumps, and grinds.

Simplicity: Basic rigid body physics with minimal setup (e.g., one body for the player, static bodies for the park).

Robustness: Stable for real-time calculations, optimized for browser performance.

3. Mobile Controls: NippleJS
Purpose: Virtual joystick for touch controls on mobile web.

Why It’s Best:
Tiny (~10 KB minified), keeping the game lightweight.

Specifically designed for browser-based touch input (no native app complexity).

Easy to integrate with ThreeJS for movement and trick inputs.

Works out-of-the-box on iPhone Safari and Android Chrome.

Use Case: Left joystick for movement, right-side gestures or joystick for tricks/jumps.

Simplicity: Plug-and-play with customizable zones and events.

Robustness: Reliable touch handling, responsive on low-end devices.

4. Development: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
Purpose: Core game logic and glue between libraries.

Why It’s Best:
No framework overhead (e.g., React or Vue would add unnecessary complexity).

Native browser support, no build tools required for basic setup.

Direct control over ThreeJS, CannonJS, and NippleJS integration.

Use Case: Game loop, input handling (keyboard/mouse + touch), scoring, and day-night logic.

Simplicity: Plain JS keeps the codebase lean and easy to debug.

Robustness: Full control over performance-critical code, no abstraction layers.

5. Asset Management: Static Hosting (e.g., Netlify or GitHub Pages)
Purpose: Host the game on a custom domain/subdomain.

Why It’s Best:
Free tier available, no server-side setup needed.

Serves static files (HTML, JS, assets) instantly with HTTPS (required for WebGL).

No backend complexity (e.g., no database or login system).

Use Case: Deploy the game as a single HTML file with bundled JS and assets.

Simplicity: Drag-and-drop deployment or Git push.

Robustness: Scales effortlessly, reliable uptime, and fast CDN delivery.

6. Build Tool (Optional): Parcel
Purpose: Bundle JS files and assets for production.

Why It’s Best:
Zero-configuration setup (simpler than Webpack).

Minifies ThreeJS, CannonJS, and NippleJS into a single file (<300 KB total).

Handles ES6 imports and asset compression (e.g., textures).

Use Case: Combine libraries and game code into one efficient package.

Simplicity: Install via npm, run parcel index.html, and it works.

Robustness: Ensures minimal file size and optimal loading speed.

Why This Stack?
Simplicity
Minimal Dependencies: Only three core libraries (ThreeJS, CannonJS, NippleJS) plus vanilla JS.

No Backend: Static hosting eliminates server management.

Quick Setup: A functional prototype can be built in a single HTML file with inline scripts if needed.

Low Learning Curve: Each tool has straightforward APIs and examples tailored to games.

Robustness
Performance: Lightweight libraries ensure instant play (<500 KB total footprint with assets).

Cross-Platform: Works on desktop (Chrome, Firefox) and mobile web (Safari, Chrome) without modification.

Scalability: Modular design allows future features (e.g., new maps) without rewriting the stack.

Reliability: Proven tools used in countless web games, with active communities.

Meets Requirements
No Heavy Downloads: Total size kept under 1 MB with compressed assets.

No Loading Screens: Asynchronous asset loading (e.g., ThreeJS can load models in the background).

Mobile Web: NippleJS ensures touch controls work on iPhone Safari.

Free-to-Play, No Login: Static hosting and no backend enforce accessibility.
